A module for basic math in the general vicinity of computational number theory.

This is a module for basic math in the general vicinity of computational number theory. It includes functions associated with primality testing, integer factoring, prime counting, linear recurrences, modular square roots, generalized Pell equations, the classic arithmetical functions, continued fractions, partitions, St√∏rmer's theorem, smooth numbers, and Dirichlet convolution. Integer arithmetic is used wherever feasible.

This library is the successor to [https://github.com/lucasaugustus/labmath](labmath).  I broke backwards incompatibility, so I started a new repository for this version.  It is still in the alpha stage.
